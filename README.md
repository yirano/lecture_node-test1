# Unit Testing

Guided project for Node Testing 1 module.

In this module we will cover the basics of automated testing and use `jest` to write unit tests.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
- [ ] type npm install to download dependencies.

Please follow along as the instructor uses _Test Driven Development (TDD)_ to implement the `add()` feature of a simple `calculator`.


## Lecture Notes

Drawbacks
- write more code
- requires additional tooling and dependencies
- takes time to pinpoint and defug failing tests
  - also a benefit

### Types of testing

Unit Testing
- testing small pieces of code like pure functions and utility functions. same input === same output

Integration testing
- Testing how those functions are working together as a whole Endpoints, middleware stacks, etc

End-to-End testing
- testing how the system as a whole is functioning and how it's working with external resources
